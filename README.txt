           StatNLP: Hypergraph-based Structured Prediction Model
===============================================================================

This package contains StatNLP Hypergraph-based Graphical Model: A Framework for
Structured Prediction, or StatNLP Framework for short.

This framework is based on the concept of hypergraph, making it very general,
which covers linear-chain graphical models -- such as HMM, Linear-chain CRFs,
and semi-Markov CRFs --, tree-based graphical models -- such as Tree CRFs for 
constituency parsers --, and many more.

Coupled with a generic training formulation based on the generalization of the
inside-outside algorithm to acyclic hypergraphs, this framework supports the 
rapid prototyping and creation of novel graphical models, where users would 
just need to specify the graphical structure, and the framework will handle the
training procedure.

This framework has been successfully used to produce novel models in the 
following research papers:

============
Direct Usage
============
To compile, ensure Maven is installed, and simply do:

    mvn clean package

This will create a runnable JAR in the target/ directory.
Running the JAR file directly without any parameter will show the help:

    java -jar target/statnlp-core-{VERSION}.jar

For example:

    java -jar target/statnlp-core-2017.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The package comes with some predefined models, which you can directly use with
your data:

Linear-chain CRF:

    java -jar target/statnlp-core-2017.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
        --linearModelClass org.statnlp.example.linear_crf.LinearCRF \
        --trainPath data/train.data \
        --testPath data/test.data \
        --modelPath data/test.model \
        train test evaluate

The last line above defines the tasks to be executed, in that order.

This package also comes with visualization GUI to see how the graphical models
represent the input. Simply execute "visualize" task to the above, as follows:

    java -jar target/statnlp-core-2017.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
        --linearModelClass org.statnlp.example.linear_crf.LinearCRF \
        --trainPath data/train.data \
        visualize

In the visualization, you can drag the canvas to move around, and you can 
scroll to zoom in/zoom out.
Also the arrow keys (left and right) can be used to show the previous and next
instances.

===================
Building New Models
===================
To help understanding the whole package, here we first describe the components
of the framework:
- FeatureManager - The class where you can implement the feature extractor
- NetworkCompiler - The class where you can implement the graphical model
- Instance - The data structure to store the input and the corresponding
             network structures. This is also used to store the gold output and
             the predictions made by the model during testing.

If your task requires input which is linear (e.g., tokenized sentences), then
you can use the built-in LinearInstance<OUT> where OUT is the output type, such
as Label in the case of POS tagging, or Tree in constituency parsing.
If the input is linear, there is also a built-in FeatureManager than can take
in feature templates: TemplateBasedFeatureManager, similar to the feature
template used in CRF++.

The main class you may want to implement is then the NetworkCompiler, which is
the core part where the graphical models are defined.

This guide will be updated in the future, but for now, you can follow the 
examples written in the src/main/java/com/statnlp/example directory, with 
the corresponding main class at src/main/test/com/statnlp/example directory to
execute the models.
